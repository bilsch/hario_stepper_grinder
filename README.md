Hario stepper driver based coffee grinder
==

This is a hack I put together. I love my [hario grinder](http://www.hario.jp/product/list.php?middelclass=1) ( MSCS-2TB ) but when I upgraded to the chemex grinding that much beans per pot just got annoying.

I am creating a reduction gear set similar to the extruder gears I use on my Wades extruder. I really liked the sturdiness of the [Lulzbot](http://devel.lulzbot.com/TAZ/3.1/production_parts/OpenSCAD/) gears and the drive gear set I'm using are a clone of the lulzbot modified scad files.

Note, this is still a work-in-progress.

Basic concept
==

Simple stepper reduction.

For now, I'm starting with drive gears which are simply large enough to fit
